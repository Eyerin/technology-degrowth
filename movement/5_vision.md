5. Vision: place for visioning, suggestions or wishes, e.g. along the questions: From the perspective of your social movement and in relation to degrowth: which opportunities do you see for the development of a strong common emancipatory social movement in the current context (ongoing crises, emergence of right wing parties, post-democracy etc.?) What should a larger social movement look like so you'd join?


A big challenge for researchers and action-researchers on technology and degrowth lies ahead: while it is desirable for researchers to engage in the actual production of (free and open) technology, it is simultaneously important for these to combine with existing efforts coming from the DIY, hackers and other grassroots movements. The technology is there, but building up a solid social-technological development aimed at creating the underlying infrastructures and processes supporting a transition towards, or compatible with a postgrowth society, asks for more resources from different sides. 

Making research projects to accumulate even more knowledge on how things work or should work is really not the interesting thing to do today. We rather need more convivial research (Vetter, 2015) in the field, capable of bringing scientists - also non-technical ones - to the collaborative development of platforms, onthologies and vocabularies for data openness and interoperability. Supporting events such as hackathons, or using (and supporting) commons server infrastructure and free software services are examples of actions that support the transformations and resistances happening in the field of technology and the digital commons.

Rushkoff and Vial might not even identify themselves as degrowthers. But we see a pattern emerging, which brings together (some) social businesses, the do-it-yourself culture, the capitalist-critical grassroots, the commons and free software movements. They converge on the will to (re)appropriate and decommercialize technology. They organize and often collaborate in building up the "learning webs" by Illich in the 1970's, which at the present times effectively exist and have become part of our daily lives, after the invention of the World-Wide-Web. It got further strengthened - or rather, released from the institutional boundaries and centralization, of which Illich is so critical - on the peer-to-peer technologies.
