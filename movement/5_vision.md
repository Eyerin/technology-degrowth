5. Vision: place for visioning, suggestions or wishes, e.g. along the questions: From the perspective of your social movement and in relation to degrowth: which opportunities do you see for the development of a strong common emancipatory social movement in the current context (ongoing crises, emergence of right wing parties, post-democracy etc.?) What should a larger social movement look like so you'd join?

The philosophy promoted by the free software movement is in fact very close to the sources of democracy, autonomy and justice which are at the roots of the degrowth movement, inspired by authors such as Ivan Illich or Cornelius Castoriadis. 

Close to the concept of autonomy of Cornelius Castoriadis, one can identify in Ivan Illich's work (Illich, 1970) an approach to technology where the focus is on the institutional model and way of distribution, rather than being critical on technology per se (although he's usually perceived as being strongly anti-technology). Pushing on criticism towards a centralized approach to distribution of learning content, Illich explains how with the same amount of money invested on building up a TV broadcast for state and corporate controlled contents, could be replaced by a tape recorders network, allowing a much larger group both not only to receive, but also to produce and disseminate information.

These dimensions of democracy and justice have been subjected to strong debate among some of the main references of the degrowth movement: these converge on the importance of having access to technology and the capacity to understand and use the technology without resorting to huge institutions (nowadays mostly corporations). One can see such concerns shared by Richard Stallman.- The open source guru (GNU Foundation) mentioned on last years' Chaos Communication Congress (the largest hackers congress in Europe) that "teaching children to use proprietary software is like teaching them to smoke".

Collective ownership of technical infrastructures and data, interoperability, linked open data (LOD), and the semantic web with its vocabularies and ontologies are some words that are expected to appear more and more in the discourses engaged in building up postgrowth futures. As Silke Helfrich mentioned at the recent international solidarity economy congress (Solikon) in Berlin, "if you control the infrastructures of production, you don't need certification". It is hard to imagine that Ivan Illich would not feel excited about the convivial, deschooling and deinstitutionalization potential of the world wide web and an underlying commons infrastructure.

A big challenge for researchers and action-researchers on technology and degrowth lies ahead: while it is desirable for researchers to engage in the actual production of (free and open) technology, it is simultaneously important for these to combine with existing efforts coming from the DIY, hackers and other grassroots movements. The technology is there, but building up a solid social-technological development aimed at creating the underlying infrastructures and processes supporting a transition towards, or compatible with a postgrowth society, asks for more resources from different sides. 

Making research projects to accumulate even more knowledge on how things work or should work is really not the interesting thing to do today. We rather need more convivial research (Vetter, 2015) in the field, capable of bringing scientists - also non-technical ones - to the collaborative development of platforms, onthologies and vocabularies for data openness and interoperability. Supporting events such as hackathons, or using (and supporting) commons server infrastructure and free software services are examples of actions that support the transformations and resistances happening in the field of technology and the digital commons.

Rushkoff and Vial might not even identify themselves as degrowthers. But we see a pattern emerging, which brings together (some) social businesses, the do-it-yourself culture, the capitalist-critical grassroots, the commons and free software movements. They converge on the will to (re)appropriate and decommercialize technology. They organize and often collaborate in building up the "learning webs" by Illich in the 1970's, which at the present times effectively exist and have become part of our daily lives, after the invention of the World-Wide-Web. It got further strengthened - or rather, released from the institutional boundaries and centralization, of which Illich is so critical - on the peer-to-peer technologies.
