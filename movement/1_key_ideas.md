1. What is the key idea of the social movement (most important critiques of the current system, central arguments, ideas for alternatives), how did the movement develop historically and what is the idea of societal change?

The key idea behind the free software movement is to give the ability to the users of software - which is present in basically any electronic devices we use today - to have freedom to run, study and change the software, and to redistribute it in any way. The free software movement appears officially in the 1980's, as a reaction to the increasing dominance of proprietary software (which started emerging in the late 60s with the increasing production costs of ever more complex software). In contrast to proprietary software, which maps to an industrial competition environment protected by patent systems, the philosophy of free software focuses on removing any restrictions from the use and modifications of software, which are an obstacle to cooperation between peers. It aims in that way at promoting the progress of technology with the goal "to liberate everyone in cyberspace" (Stallman, 2006).

> "If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality."

Today we observe the emergence of new patterns of production and consumption of technology. Social-technological innovations, rather than pure technological innovations, seem to be the dominant pattern of innovation. Code development and recombination "factories", such as the famous GitHub have become social networks for a global sharing of digital production. At the hardware level, FabLabs, Repair Caf√©s or Open Source Ecology are sharing their knowledge globally, based on their accumulated experiences while articulating production and learning with their local communities (of practice).

In fact, the open source movement has provided an example on how to overcome the role division of specialized producers (the IT specialists) and the consumer (end users). The concept of commons-based peer production (CBPP) emerged recently as a socio-economic system anchored on the same ideas of exchange and participation that the digital era brought: groups of individuals join to work together to produce information, knowledge or cultural goods from and for the commons (Benkler and Nissenbaum, 2006).
