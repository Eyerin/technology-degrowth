1. What is the key idea of the social movement (most important critiques of the current system, central arguments, ideas for alternatives), how did the movement develop historically and what is the idea of societal change?

Today we observe the emergence of new patterns of production and consumption of technology. Social-technological innovations, rather than pure technological innovations, seem to be the dominant pattern of innovation. Code development and recombination "factories", such as the famous GitHub have become social networks for a global sharing of digital production. At the hardware level, FabLabs, Repair Cafés or Open Source Ecology are sharing their knowledge globally, based on their accumulated experiences while articulating production and learning with their local communities (of practice).

In fact, the open source movement has provided an example on how to overcome the role division of specialized producers (the IT specialists) and the consumer (end users). The concept of commons-based peer production (CBPP) emerged recently as a socio-economic system anchored on the same ideas of exchange and participation that the digital era brought: groups of individuals join to work together to produce information, knowledge or cultural goods from and for the commons (Benkler and Nissenbaum, 2006).

This blurring of roles, which Alvin Toffler designated as „prosumers“, might nevertheless contribute to generate new forms of capitalist exploitation, through the tendency towards generating unpaid labor, while keeping power and decision structures untouched (Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010; Rogero, 2010). Bauwens (2006) and Benkler and Nissenbaum (2006), argue, however, that peer production which follows the distributed logic of P2P and CBPP may operate independently from the market logic or existing power structures.

Technological autonomy and data ownership

> "If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality."
