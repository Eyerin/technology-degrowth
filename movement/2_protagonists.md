2. Who is part of the movement, who are its protagonists, what do they do and why (social stratification, how and where are they organized; which groups, which alliances etc. are there; what are the strategies...)?


// TODO: better describe what type of collectives, organisations, etc. operate in this context - also determine who actually is the "we" in this whole article: the free software movement? the hackers' scene? stacktivists? digital commoners?

// TODO: Improve integration of interesting current developments

From autonomous and grassroots political movements, to transition initiatives or the broad range of „nowtopias“ (Carlsson and Manning, 2010), learning and innovation seems to be taking place at a pace never seen before. Despite the diversity of actors and praxis in the degrowth movement, they have been converging in temporary and permanent spaces that appear as a response to the crisis (Demaria et al., 2013). By exploring these contradictions, researchers and activists can develop a sustainability dialectics (Giampietro, 2004; Baptista, 2011) that is capable of dealing with the multiple narratives of degrowth and advancing its concepts and paths towards societal transformation.

Recently, with the dissemination of initiatives around Open Source Ecology or the FabLabs, the resource aspect has been approached. Bauwens talks about the new wave of global thought and local production - knowledge is shared across all parts, while production is localized. He uses the example of a tractor, built with parts that can be built by anyone and which building schemes are available for general use. Community networks supported by wireless (open source) technology such as the Freifunk initiative contribute to a grassroots development of "mesh networks" and directly contribute to distribute ownership of internet infrastructure. The low cost Raspberry Pi, among other "smart devices" can then serve, for example by installing the "FreedomBox" software, for having an own cloud and server for as low as 30 €, consuming around 10 W and fitting in the palm of the hands.

The idea of commons has been particularly prolific in the digital sphere. The movements and development behind Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) has been able to generate the largest encyclopedia ever created, putting the Encyclopedia Britannica out of business in a few years. The Linux Kernel, has been released by the Finnish student Linus Torvalds in 1991 and consists today of over 18 million lines of source code under a license (GNU Public License or GPL) that prohibits any commercial usage of it. It's success was so immense that most of the world wide web, as well as a huge number consumer devices - from Android smartphones, to TomTom GPS - are built on top of the Linux Kernel.

A growing number of collectives worldwide are similarly working on recombining and further developing the existing free software into stacks that provide a more democratic access to services, shaped to needs and uses of the target communities. A particular interesting fund has been recently launched by the EU, to support "collective awareness platforms for sustainability and social innovation" (CAPSSI). Far from being a top-down research project, the fund specifically recognises the contribution of hacker communities and grassroots movements and is putting major efforts in networking these actors to build pilot platforms.
