2. Who is part of the movement, who are its protagonists, what do they do and why (social stratification, how and where are they organized; which groups, which alliances etc. are there; what are the strategies...)?

// TODO:  Relevant collectives and organisations in the free software movement #8 

With the source code and collective dynamics brought by the free software movement, the Wikipedia managed to bring the Encyclopedia Britannica out of business in a matter few years. Another example of such a convergence of global efforts is the Linux Kernel: the 10,239 lines of code originally released by the Finnish student Linus Torvalds in 1991, turn to over 18 million lines of source code protected as a commons by the GNU Public License. Its' success has been so immense that most of the internet, as well as a huge number consumer devices - from Android smartphones, to TomTom GPS - are built on top of the Linux Kernel. And because of the GPL Public License constraints, any piece of software built on top of it must also make their source code available. As a consequence, activity around GPL'd source code, be it non-profit or for profit, brings a contribution back to the global commons of source code and algorithms.

More recently, with the dissemination of initiatives around Open Source Ecology or the FabLabs, the resource aspect has been approached. Michael Bauwens talks about the new wave of global thought and local production - knowledge is shared across all parts, while production is localized. He uses the example of a tractor, built with parts that can be built by anyone and which building schemes are available for general use. Community networks supported by wireless (open source) technology such as the Freifunk initiative contribute to a grassroots development of "mesh networks" and directly contribute to distribute ownership of internet infrastructure. The low cost Raspberry Pi, among other "smart devices" can then serve, for example by installing the "FreedomBox" software, for having an own cloud and server for as low as 30 â‚¬, consuming around 10 W and fitting in the palm of the hands.

A growing number of collectives worldwide are working on recombining and further developing the existing free software into stacks that provide a more democratic access to services, shaped to needs and uses of the target communities. Even the EU seems to be concerned with the continuous trend of concentration of information on data silos hosted by corporations overseas (and certainly also with the privacy and state surveillance issues which *citizenfour* Edward Snowden exposed): in response, it is providing several hundred millions under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program to support "collective awareness platforms for sustainability and social innovation" (CAPSSI). Far from being a top-down research project, the fund specifically recognises the contribution of hacker communities and grassroots movements and is putting major efforts in networking these actors in consortia to build pilot platforms. New alliances are being built on these frontiers of techno-social innovation. It remains to see what effect these new platforms will have in the praxis and culture of the social movements.
