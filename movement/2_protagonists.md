// TODO: better describe what type of collectives, organisations, etc. operate in this context - also determine who actually is the "we" in this whole article: the free software movement? the hackers' scene? stacktivists? digital commoners?

A growing number of collectives worldwide are similarly working on recombining and further developing the existing free software into stacks that provide a more democratic access to services, shaped to needs and uses of the target communities. A particular interesting fund has been recently launched by the EU, to support "collective awareness platforms for sustainability and social innovation" (CAPSSI). Far from being a top-down research project, the fund specifically recognises the contribution of hacker communities and grassroots movements and is putting major efforts in networking these actors to build pilot platforms.
