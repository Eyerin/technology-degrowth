4. Which proposals has this movement for the degrowth perspective? (What is missing, which problems are out of the picture, what is underestimated, what themes, questions, problems aren't discussed at all or in an insufficient way?) Which proposals can the degrowth perspective offer to the movement?

The main historical contributions of the free software movement have probably been on the production of digital commons: source code, data, information, algorithms, knowledge. But also a whole culture of collaboration based on the ideas of freedom and autonomy, materialized in the already mentioned global collective efforts of the Wikipedia or the Linux Kernel. On the other hand, we also see how big businesses are using freely contributed software increase profits and enable further concentration on their applications and platforms.

The developments and new modes of production and consumption being pushed by the so-called Sharing Economy also provide interesting insights into the degrowth debate. Maurie Cohen, while addressing the issues of the Sharing Economy, recently wrote, "the antagonism between producers and consumers that is inherent in predominant systems of exchange frequently results in consumption in excess of genuine needs -- often through the use of tempting volume discounts and the manufacture of goods that become prematurely obsolete." Rather than completely dismissing the patterns of exchange of the sharing economy, Cohen thus argues that through the development of "reciprocal relationships, producer-consumer cooperatives could bring the intentions of production and consumption into closer alignment". The challenge would be to develop a "more efficacious sharing economy" capable of constraining the "expansion of mediated micro-entrepreneurship and serialized rental in favor of modes consistent with communitarian provisioning". Cohen speaks for platform cooperativism as an alternative institutional setting for enabling these new patterns of reciprocal relationships and alignment of producers and consumers to bring better value to society.

This blurring of roles between producers and consumers, enabled by technology, and at the core of the praxis of the Sharing Economy and a broad range of social businesses, leads to the emergence of a new type of economical agent, which futurist Alvin Toffler designated as „prosumers“. Critics express that these might nevertheless contribute to generate new forms of capitalist exploitation, through the tendency towards generating unpaid labor, while keeping power and decision structures untouched (Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010; Rogero, 2010). Bauwens (2006) and Benkler and Nissenbaum (2006), argue, however, that peer production which follows the distributed logic of P2P and CBPP may operate independently from the market logic or existing power structures. One of the proposals of the P2P Foundation is an alternative license to the GPL, "in which only other commoners, cooperatives and nonprofits can share and re-use the material, but not commercial entities intent on making profit through the commons without explicit reciprocity". This license has nevertheless received broad criticism and up to now did not manage to achieve a significant expression.

It is visible from the debate that the configuration that such new processes and roles will take, plays closely with how the institutional setting at the social and technological level is shaped. The degrowth intellectual debates around democracy, autonomy, institutions and technology can certainly provide valuable insights to the controversies (at both the technological and social/institutional levels) around the typology of the networks to be built. Should we support distributed networks, where each agent is autonomous and rules tend to be global and automated (through distributed public ledgers such as the *blockchain* developed as part of the infamous *bitcoin* cryptocurrency), or should we rather federate communities around infrastructure, which may be shaped according to more localized rules and institutions?

Addressing the accumulation and appropriation of big data (the new capital) by corporations and states, linked open data may contribute to a world of massively scaled small data hosted on a federated commons cloud. The praxis of the collectives on this is one of engaging in collective and federated production processes. The TransforMap project, an initiative involving dozens of networks, NGOs and initiatives worldwide, aims at building a federation of many maps of the alternative economies. Within this process it combines network and community building and agile management practices, with events such as mapping jams, hackathons or vocamps. The goal is to develop a technological stack and an associated social process that is capable of providing meaning and use for the diversel of narratives and movements emerging as a response to the limits of growth and the current multiple crises.

The technology for deploying such an infrastructure is available now and at the software level it is even open. But what institutional settings could support such a cloud infrastructure to be largely deployed and to overcome Facebook, Google or Condoleeza's Dropbox? The focus on the technological development and a secondarization of the governance and politics of technological infrastructure may be one of the weakest aspects of the free and open source movement.
