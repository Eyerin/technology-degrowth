4. Which proposals has this movement for the degrowth perspective? (What is missing, which problems are out of the picture, what is underestimated, what themes, questions, problems aren't discussed at all or in an insufficient way?) Which proposals can the degrowth perspective offer to the movement?

The developments and new modes of production and consumption being pushed by the so-called Sharing Economy provide interesting insights into the degrowth debate. 

Addressing the accumulation and appropriation of big data (the new capital) by corporations and states, linked open data may contribute to a world of massively scaled small data hosted on a federated commons cloud. 

The technology for deploying such an infrastructure is available now and at the software level it is even open. But what institutional settings could support such a cloud infrastructure to be largely deployed and to overcome Facebook, Google or Condoleeza's Dropbox? The focus on the technological development and a secondarization of the governance and politics of technological infrastructure may be one of the weakest aspects of the free and open source movement.

Nevertheless, even if open source software has meanwhile become the business of giants (Google is the major example, but even Microsoft, an epic opposer of open source software, has now hundreds of open source projects in development), these issues are being targeted by movements associated to and emerging from the free software culture. More recently, with the dissemination of initiatives around Open Source Ecology or the FabLabs, the resource aspect has been approached. Bauwens talks about the new wave of global thought and local production - knowledge is shared across all parts, while production is localized. He uses the example of a tractor, built with parts that can be built by anyone and which building schemes are available for general use. Community networks supported by wireless (open source) technology such as the Freifunk initiative contribute to a grassroots development of "mesh networks" and directly contribute to distribute ownership of internet infrastructure. The low cost Raspberry Pi, among other "smart devices" can then serve, for example by installing the "FreedomBox" software, for having an own cloud and server for as low as 30 â‚¬, consuming around 10 W and fitting in the palm of the hands.

The idea of commons has been particularly prolific in the digital sphere. The movements and development behind Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) has been able to generate the largest encyclopedia ever created, putting the Encyclopedia Britannica out of business in a few years. The Linux Kernel, has been released by the Finnish student Linus Torvalds in 1991 and consists today of over 18 million lines of source code under a license (GNU Public License or GPL) that prohibits any commercial usage of it. It's success was so immense that most of the world wide web, as well as a huge number consumer devices - from Android smartphones, to TomTom GPS - are built on top of the Linux Kernel.

// TODO: Synthesize Cohen's arguments/critique on the sharing economy

Maurie Cohen, addressing the issues of the sharing economy, recently wrote, "the antagonism between producers and consumers that is inherent in predominant systems of exchange frequently results in consumption in excess of genuine needs -- often through the use of tempting volume discounts and the manufacture of goods that become prematurely obsolete." As such, rather than completely dismissing the patterns of exchange of the sharing economy, Cohen argues that through the development of "reciprocal relationships, producer-consumer cooperatives could bring the intentions of production and consumption into closer alignment". The challenge would be to develop a "more efficacious sharing economy" capable of constraining the "expansion of mediated micro-entrepreneurship and serialized rental in favor of modes consistent with communitarian provisioning". 

Cohen speaks about platform cooperativism as an alternative. The praxis of the collectives on this is one of engaging in collective and federated production processes. An example can be the TransforMap project. It is an initiative involving dozens of networks, NGOs and initiatives worldwide, aiming at building up the "mother of many maps" for the alternative economies. Within this process it combines network and community building, agile development practices (scrum) with events such as mapping jams, hackathons or vocamps. All with the goal to develop a technological stack that is capable of providing meaning and use for the diversel of narratives and movements emerging as a response to the limits of growth and the current multiple crises.
