4. Which proposals has this movement for the degrowth perspective? (What is missing, which problems are out of the picture, what is underestimated, what themes, questions, problems aren't discussed at all or in an insufficient way?) Which proposals can the degrowth perspective offer to the movement?

The developments and new modes of production and consumption being pushed by the so-called Sharing Economy provide interesting insights into the degrowth debate. As Maurie Cohen recently wrote, "the antagonism between producers and consumers that is inherent in predominant systems of exchange frequently results in consumption in excess of genuine needs -- often through the use of tempting volume discounts and the manufacture of goods that become prematurely obsolete." As such, rather than completely dismissing the patterns of exchange of the sharing economy, Cohen argues that through the development of "reciprocal relationships, producer-consumer cooperatives could bring the intentions of production and consumption into closer alignment". The challenge would be to develop a "more efficacious sharing economy" capable of constraining the "expansion of mediated micro-entrepreneurship and serialized rental in favor of modes consistent with communitarian provisioning". 

Cohen speaks about platform cooperativism as an alternative. The praxis of the collectives on this is one of engaging in collective and federated production processes. An example can be the TransforMap project. It is an initiative involving dozens of networks, NGOs and initiatives worldwide, aiming at building up the "mother of many maps" for the alternative economies. Within this process it combines network and community building, agile development practices (scrum) with events such as mapping jams, hackathons or vocamps. All with the goal to develop a technological stack that is capable of providing meaning and use for the diversel of narratives and movements emerging as a response to the limits of growth and the current multiple crises.
