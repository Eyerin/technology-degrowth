3. How do you see the relation between this movement and degrowth and how can or should this relation develop within the next years? How is the relation to other social movements? (Relation means e.g. similarities, differences, conflicts, alliances etc.)

Within the degrowth movement, technology, and especially digital technology, is seen by many as something to reduce or remove as much as possible from life and society. The Internet is, under this narrative, seen as a contradiction to a simple, ecological and convivial living. Certainly, increased resource use, both associated with the production of artifacts of modern technology, but also to potential rebound effects emerging from the increase of efficiency are feared and criticized - and not without reason: modern technological advances are mostly resulting from and used as tools for further optimization and efficiency of operations, industrial advancement and ultimately growth.

The complexity of the resulting industrial-technological complex is today supported by large institutions and corporations. These progressively distance its users from the technological choices and agency, from the infrastructure that hosts it, the processes of technological production and of the resource extraction necessary for its maintenance.

Media theorist Douglas Rushkoff has recently written a book describing this new industrial age we are going through. One that is no longer represented by the mechanical, huge, 19th century factory, but rather by brands, titans of the digital world, which establish their monopolies with socially networked platforms. These are presented as a spike of a late or new capitalism times: massive amounts of venture capitals are injected into ideas emerging into the digital society, with the objective of capturing as many users and data as possible, and eventually establish a monopoly and universality in the service provision: no one should get a ride if not on Uber, no one should find friends if not on Facebook, no one should find a date if not on Tinder. Still, the same Rushkoff - and along with him a few other intellectuals, hackers and activists in the collaborative economy, free software movement and commons - sees the internet as having a distributive power without precedents in the history of Humanity.

Up to now, research and praxis on degrowth has unfortunately brought too little contribution in building up a coherent, critical vision on different innovations and movements that are emerging on the digital technology scene. On the contrary, there is often a distancing of the actors of degrowth from touching the technological aspects - as if diving and getting busy with it would come into conflict with the meaning of life, voluntary simplicity and some back-to-the-roots romantism that are embedded into the degrowth movement.

It is true that at the resource level, the technology of the digital age contributes to an environmental and social disaster. Initiatives such as the fairphone or the fair mouse just reveal how difficult it is to actually achieve a fair and ecological production of things as "simple" as a mouse for the computer. But how far are concepts such as the (fully) automated production, smart cities, cryptocurrencies, the internet of things or big data from forming part of degrowth utopias? What do we need to do, how do we need to shape them, so that they contribute towards a radical distribution, rather than to the furthering of capitalism accummulation and increase of societal dependency on services provided by corporations? How can actors and institutions relatedto degrowth (not) achieved n terms of getting control over the technology they use? 


// TODO: Integrate critique on prosumers
This blurring of roles, which Alvin Toffler designated as „prosumers“, might nevertheless contribute to generate new forms of capitalist exploitation, through the tendency towards generating unpaid labor, while keeping power and decision structures untouched (Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010; Rogero, 2010). Bauwens (2006) and Benkler and Nissenbaum (2006), argue, however, that peer production which follows the distributed logic of P2P and CBPP may operate independently from the market logic or existing power structures.
